ANALYSIS SUGGESTIONS
=========================================
1. Failure Reduction:
   - Investigate the most common error codes and their causes
   - Check server resources during peak failure times

2. Peak Times:
   - Consider scaling resources during high traffic hours

3. Security:
   - Monitor IPs with unusually high request rates
   - Check for patterns in failed requests that might indicate attacks

4. System Improvements:
   - Optimize endpoints with most failures
   - Consider caching for frequently accessed resources
